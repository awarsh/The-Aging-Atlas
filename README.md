# The-Aging-Atlas
An interactive application developed to explore the changes in protein expression that occur with aging. The application facilitates a comparative study between young and aged mice, aiming to elucidate the alterations in protein profiles and gain comprehensive insights into the biological mechanisms underlying aging.

Users can start by specifying whether they would like to analyze genes or proteins using the radio button provided. They can then decide the number of genes or proteins they wish to compare, utilizing the relevant input option. After selecting the quantity, users will need to specify exactly which genes or proteins they intend to analyze.
